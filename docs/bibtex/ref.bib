Identifying singlets with high fidelity in single-cell RNA sequencing is necessary to avoid false negative and false positive discoveries. Although several methodologies have been proposed to infer true singlets and doublets, they typically rely on datasets being highly heterogeneous. Here we develop and apply singletCode, a computational framework that leverages datasets with synthetically introduced DNA barcodes for a hitherto unexplored application: to extract ground truth singlets. We demonstrate the feasibility of singlets extracted via singletCode to evaluate the performance and robustness of existing doublet detection methods. We find that existing doublet detection methods are not as sensitive as expected when tested on doublets simulated from experimentally realistic ground truth singlets. As DNA barcoded datasets are being increasingly reported, singletCode can identify singlets and inform rational choice of doublet detecting algorithms and their associated limitations.Competing Interest StatementYG received consultancy fees from the Schmidt Science Fellows.

However, current methods often result in two or more cells that share the same cell-identifying barcode; these “doublets” violate the fundamental premise of single-cell technology and can lead to incorrect inferences. Here, we describe Solo, a semi-supervised deep learning approach that identifies doublets with greater accuracy than existing methods. Solo embeds cells unsupervised using a variational autoencoder and then appends a feed-forward neural network layer to the encoder to form a supervised classifier. We train this classifier to distinguish simulated doublets from the observed data. Solo can be applied in combination with experimental doublet detection methods to further purify scRNA-seq data to true single cells. It is freely available from https://github.com/calico/solo.

The existence of doublets, which appear to be-but are not-real cells, is a key confounder in scRNA-seq data analysis. Computational methods have been developed to detect doublets in scRNA-seq data; however, the scRNA-seq field lacks a comprehensive benchmarking of these methods, making it difficult for researchers to choose an appropriate method for specific analyses. We conducted a systematic benchmark study of nine cutting-edge computational doublet-detection methods. Our study included 16 real datasets, which contained experimentally annotated doublets, and 112 realistic synthetic datasets. We compared doublet-detection methods regarding detection accuracy under various experimental settings, impacts on downstream analyses, and computational efficiencies. Our results show that existing methods exhibited diverse performance and distinct advantages in different aspects. Overall, the DoubletFinder method has the best detection accuracy, and the cxds method has the highest computational efficiency.

The promise of this technology is attracting a growing user base for single-cell analysis methods. As more analysis tools are becoming available, it is becoming increasingly difficult to navigate this landscape and produce an up-to-date workflow to analyse one’s data. Here, we detail the steps of a typical single-cell RNA-seq analysis, including pre-processing (quality control, normalization, data correction, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction) and cell- and gene-level downstream analysis. We formulate current best-practice recommendations for these steps based on independent comparison studies. We have integrated these best-practice recommendations into a workflow, which we apply to a public dataset to further illustrate how these steps work in practice. Our documented case study can be found at https://www.github.com/theislab/single-cell-tutorial This review will serve as a workflow tutorial for new entrants into the field, and help established users update their analysis pipelines.}, number={6}, journal={Molecular Systems Biology}, author={Luecken, Malte D. and Theis, Fabian J.}, year={2019}, month=jun, pages={e8746}, language={eng} }

Doublet detection methods
=============================

This section will contain information about the doublet detection methods, maybe their main figure along with the link to the main paper.

Using the dataset we created using the results from Singlet code as described in :ref:`mainSingletCode/benchmarking`, we benchmark four doublet detection methods - scDblFinder, DoubletFinder, Scrublet and Hybrid. 

In this section, you can find more information about each of these methods and how they perform on the benchmark.

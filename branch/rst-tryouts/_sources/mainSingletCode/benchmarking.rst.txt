Creating Benchmark datasets from Singlet Code results
=====================================================

Typical benchmarking for different doublet detection methods are created by simulating doublets and using the methods to identify these cells when mixed with singlet cells in varying percentages. However, until now, there really was no ground truth for singlets in experimental data. 

Singlet Code provides singlets that are closest possible to ground truth and can be used to simulate doublets for the benchmarking datasets.

To simulate the doublets, we randomly selected the count data from two cells we identify as true singlets. We then averaged the counts from these two cells to generate simulated doublets as performed previously :cite:`Bernstein_Fong_Lam_Roy_Hendrickson_Kelley_2020`. The final scRNA-seq datasets are generated by adding such simulated doublets into the datasets at different percentages (5-25%).

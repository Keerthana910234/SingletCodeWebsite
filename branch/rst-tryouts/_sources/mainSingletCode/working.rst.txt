How does Singlet Code detect singlets?
==========================================
Singlet Code uses the fact that the lineage barcodes are within the cell before oil encapsulation for sequencing. Therefore, a cell would have one lineage barcode or a result of multiplicity, more than barcode but with restrictions.
To be labelled a singlet, a barcoded cell needs to satisfy one of these three conditions:

    #. a single barcode identified per cell ID.
    #. multiple barcodes per cell but the same barcode combination is found in other cells in the same samples.
    #. multiple barcodes per cell but the same barcode combination is found in other cells across samples within the same experimental design (common for barcoding studies).
